🛡 1️⃣ Premium Membership System (Users Pay for VIP Travel Deals)

How It Works

👉 Normal users see limited deals

👉 VIP members get access to special flight/hotel discounts 🔥

👉 They pay a subscription fee 💰

👉 We use Stripe for secure payments


📌 Step 1: Add a Membership Page (membership.html)

html

Copy
<h2>🚀 Become a Travel VIP!</h2>
<p>Subscribe and unlock <strong>exclusive travel deals</strong> with discounts up to <b>50% OFF</b> on flights & hotels! 💰</p>
<button onclick="subscribeVIP()">💳 Get VIP Access - $10/month</button>

<!-- Show VIP content only to members -->
<div id="exclusive-deals" style="display: none;">
    <h3>🔥 VIP-Only Deals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>✈️ <b>50% OFF Flights</b> to Paris</li>
        <li>🏨 <b>40% OFF 5-Star Hotels</b> in Dubai</li>
        <li>🚄 <b>FREE Train Upgrade</b> in Europe</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
<script>
    function subscribeVIP() {
        fetch("https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Authorization": `Bearer YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`,
                "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
            },
            body: new URLSearchParams({
                payment_method_types: ["card"],
                line_items: [{ price: "price_12345", quantity: 1 }], // Replace with real Price ID from Stripe
                mode: "subscription",
                success_url: "https://yourwebsite.com/success",
                cancel_url: "https://yourwebsite.com/cancel"
            })
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(session => {
            window.location.href = session.url; // Redirect user to payment page
        })
        .catch(error => console.error("Payment Error:", error));
    }

    // Check if user is VIP
    function checkVIP() {
        let isVip = localStorage.getItem("vipUser") === "true";
        if (isVip) document.getElementById("exclusive-deals").style.display = "block";
    }

    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", checkVIP);
</script>

        document.getElementById("vip-warning").style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById("vip-deals").style.display = "block";
    }
</script>

📊 3️⃣ User Analytics System

How It Works

💡 Track your site’s most popular destinations

📍 See which flights/hotels get booked the most

📈 Know how many VIP users are subscribing

✅ We’ll use Google Analytics for tracking EVERYTHING!

✅ See which destinations & deals perform BEST!


📌 Step 1: Sign Up for Google Analytics

1️⃣ Go to Google Analytics

2️⃣ Create an account for your travel site

3️⃣ **Get your Google Analytics Tracking Code


📌 Step 2: Add Analytics to EVERY Page (index.html, destinations.html, etc.)

🔥 Paste this <script> inside the <head> tag of EVERY page!

html

Copy
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_TRACKING_ID"></script>
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){ dataLayer.push(arguments); }
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'YOUR_TRACKING_ID'); // Replace with your actual tracking ID
</script>

js

Copy
function trackDestination(city) {
    if (window.gtag) {
